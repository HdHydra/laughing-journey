This is jupiter notebook project is built by Riwader Nabhan as part of online course 'Pyton for Data Science Basics' by Elite Techno Groups.

* This notebook works with pandas and numpy libraries
* It takes input data from googleplaystore.csv downloaded from https://kaggle.com
* It does not use Imputer from SimpleImputer to find mean and median of each column to fill the NaN in numpy arrays
* It simply dropes rows with NaN values
* It can catagorise each column based on its unique values and figure number of apps with similiar attributes
* That's all now you can enjoy!
